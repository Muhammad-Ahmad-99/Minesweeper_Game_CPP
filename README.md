# Minesweeper Game in C++

A console-based Minesweeper game built from scratch in **C++**. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, custom data structures, and algorithm implementation.

---

## Features
- Playable Minesweeper game in the console
- Dynamic grid with custom size and mine count
- Flood-fill algorithm for revealing empty cells
- Scoring system based on moves and safe cells revealed
- Displays the grid with hidden/revealed cells and mines

---

## Data Structures & Concepts Used
- **Classes & Templates:** Cell, Row, Queue, TwoDQueue
- **Circular Queue:** Used for grid rows and flood-fill (BFS)
- **Flood-fill Algorithm:** For revealing connected empty cells
- **Random Mine Placement & Neighbor Counting**
